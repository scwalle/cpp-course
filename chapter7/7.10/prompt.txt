Write a program that will allow two users to play tic-tac-toe. The program
should ask for moves alternately from player X and player o. The program
displays the game positions as follows:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

The players enter their moves by entering the position number they wish
to mark. After each move, the program displays the changed board. A
sample board configuration is as follows:

X X O
4 5 6
O 8 9
