Hexadecimal numerals are integers written in base 16. The 16 digits used
are ‘0’ through ‘9’ plus ‘a’ for the “digit 10”, ‘b’ for the “digit 11”, ‘c’ for
the “digit 12”, ‘d’ for the “digit 13”, ‘e’ for the “digit 14”, and ‘f ’ for the
“digit 15”. For example, the hexadecimal numeral d is the same as base 10
numeral 13 and the hexadecimal numeral 1d is the same as the base
10 numeral 29. Write a C++ program to perform addition of two hexadeci-
mal numerals each with up to 10 digits. If the result of the addition is more
than 10 digits long, then simply give the output message “Addition over-
flow” and not the result of the addition. use arrays to store hexadecimal
numerals as arrays of characters. Include a loop to repeat this calculation
for new numbers until the user says she or he wants to end the program.
