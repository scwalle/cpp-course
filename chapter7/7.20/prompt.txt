The Social Security Administration maintains an actuarial life table that
contains the probability that a person in the united States will die (http://
www.ssa.gov/oACT/STATS/table4c6.html). The death probabilities from
this table for 2009 are stored in the file LifeDeathProbability.txt and
it is included on the website for the book. There are three values for each
row, the age, death probability for a male, and death probability for a
female. For example, the first five lines are:

0 0.006990 0.005728
1 0.000447 0.000373
2 0.000301 0.000241
3 0.000233 0.000186
4 0.000177 0.000150

This says that a 3 year old female has a 0.000186 chance of dying.
Write a program that reads the data into arrays from the file. next, let the
user enter his or her sex and age. The program should simulate to what
age the user will live by starting with the death probability for the userâ€™s
current age and sex. Generate a random number between 0-1; if this
number is less than or equal to the death probability then predict that
the user will live to the current age. If the random number is greater
than the death probability then increase the age by one and repeat the
calculation with a new random number for the next probability value.
If the simulation reaches age 120 then stop and predict that the user will
live to 120. This program is merely a simulation and will give different
results each time it is run, assuming you change the seed for the random
number generator.
