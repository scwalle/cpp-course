An employee is paid at a rate of $16.78 per hour for the first 40 hours
worked in a week. Any hours over that are paid at the overtime rate of one-
and-one-half times that. From the worker’s gross pay, 6% is withheld for
social security tax, 14% is withheld for federal income tax, 5% is withheld
for state income tax, and $10 per week is withheld for union dues. If the
worker has three or more dependents, then an additional $35 is withheld
to cover the extra cost of health insurance beyond what the employer pays.
Write a program that will read in the number of hours worked in a week
and the number of dependents as input and will then output the worker’s
gross pay, each withholding amount, and the net take-home pay for the
week. For a harder version, write your program so that it allows the calcula-
tion to be repeated as often as the user wishes. If this is a class exercise, ask
your instructor whether you should do this harder version.
