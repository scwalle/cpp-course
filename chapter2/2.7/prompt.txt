It is difficult to make a budget that spans several years, because prices are
not stable. If your company needs 200 pencils per year, you cannot sim-
ply use this yearâ€™s price as the cost of pencils 2 years from now. Because
of inflation the cost is likely to be higher than it is today. Write a program
to gauge the expected cost of an item in a specified number of years. The
program asks for the cost of the item, the number of years from now that
the item will be purchased, and the rate of inflation. The program then
outputs the estimated cost of the item after the specified period. Have
the user enter the inflation rate as a percentage, like 5.6 (percent). Your
program should then convert the percent to a fraction, like 0.056, and
should use a loop to estimate the price adjusted for inflation. (Hint: This
is similar to computing interest on a charge card account, which was dis-
cussed in this chapter.)
