Write a program that tells what coins to give out for any amount of change
from 1 cent to 99 cents. For example, if the amount is 86 cents, the output
would be something like the following:
86 cents can be given as
3 quarter(s) 1 dime(s) and 1 penny(pennies)
Use coin denominations of 25 cents (quarters), 10 cents (dimes), and 1 cent
(pennies). Do not use nickel and half-dollar coins. Your program will use
the following function (among others):

void compute_coins(int coin_value, int& num, int& amount_left);
//Precondition: 0 < coin_value < 100; 0 <= amount_left < 100.
//Postcondition: num has been set equal to the maximum number
//of coins of denomination coin_value cents that can be obtained
//from amount_left. Additionally, amount_left has been decreased
//by the value of the coins, that is, decreased by
//num * coin_value.

For example, suppose the value of the variable amount_left is 86. Then,
after the following call, the value of number will be 3 and the value of
amount_left will be 11 (because if you take 3 quarters from 86 cents, that
leaves 11 cents):
compute_coins(25, number, amount_left);
Include a loop that lets the user repeat this computation for new input
values until the user says he or she wants to end the program. (Hint: Use
integer division and the % operator to implement this function.)
