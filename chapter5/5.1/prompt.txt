Write a program that converts from 24-hour notation to 12-hour notation.
For example, it should convert 14:25 to 2:25 PM. The input is given as two
integers. There should be at least three functions, one for input, one to do the
conversion, and one for output. Record the AM/PM information as a value of
type char, ‘A’ for AM and ‘P’ for PM. Thus, the function for doing the conver-
sions will have a call-by-reference formal parameter of type char to record
whether it is AM or PM. (The function will have other parameters as well.)
Include a loop that lets the user repeat this computation for new input values
again and again until the user says he or she wants to end the program.
