Write a program that will read in a line of text and output the number of
words in the line and the number of occurrences of each letter. Define
a word to be any string of letters that is delimited at each end by either
whitespace, a period, a comma, or the beginning or end of the line. You
can assume that the input consists entirely of letters, whitespace, commas,
and periods. When outputting the number of letters that occur in a line, be
sure to count upper- and lowercase versions of a letter as the same letter.
Output the letters in alphabetical order and list only those letters that do
occur in the input line. For example, the input line

I say Hi.

should produce output similar to the following:

3 words
1 a
1 h
2 i
1 s
1 y
