Write a program that reads in a sentence of up to 100 characters and
outputs the sentence with spacing corrected and with letters corrected for
capitalization. In other words, in the output sentence, all strings of two or
more blanks should be compressed to a single blank. The sentence should
start with an uppercase letter but should contain no other uppercase
letters. Do not worry about proper names; if their first letters are changed
to lowercase, that is acceptable. Treat a line break as if it were a blank, in
the sense that a line break and any number of blanks are compressed to a
single blank. Assume that the sentence ends with a period and contains no
other periods. For example, the input

the 	Answer to life, the Universe, and everything
IS 42.

should produce the following output:
The answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42.
