Write a program that reads in a line of text and outputs the line with all the
digits in all integer numbers replaced with 'x'. For example,

Input:
My userID is john17 and my 4 digit pin is 1234 which is secret.

Output:
My userID is john17 and my x digit pin is xxxx which is secret.

Note that if a digit is part of a word, then the digit is not changed to an
'x'. For example, note that john17 is NOT changed to johnxx. Include
a loop that allows the user to repeat this calculation again until the user
says she or he wants to end the program.
