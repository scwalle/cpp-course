Based on the log file described in Programming Project 16 write a program
to detect cheating. This could occur if:

• A racer misses a sensor, which is a sign that the racer may have taken a
shortcut.
• A race split is suspiciously fast, which is a sign that the racer may have
hopped in a vehicle. In this case, a race split faster than 4:30 per mile
can be considered suspicious.

The output should be a list of suspected cheaters along with the reason
for suspicion.
