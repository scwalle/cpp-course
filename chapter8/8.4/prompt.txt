Write a program that reads a personâ€™s name in the following format: first
name, then middle name or initial, and then last name. The program then
outputs the name in the following format:

Last_Name, First_Name Middle_Initial.

For example, the input

Mary Average User

should produce the output:

User, Mary A.

The input

Mary A. User

should also produce the output:

User, Mary A.

Your program should work the same and place a period after the middle
initial even if the input did not contain a period. Your program should
allow for users who give no middle name or middle initial. In that case,
the output, of course, contains no middle name or initial. For example,
the input

Mary User

should produce the output

User, Mary

If you are using C strings, assume that each name is at most 20 characters
long. Alternatively, use the class string.

(Hint: You may want to use three string variables rather than one large
string variable for the input. You may find it easier to not use getline.)
