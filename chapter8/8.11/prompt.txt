Your country is at war and your enemies are using a secret code to com-
municate with each other. You have managed to intercept a message that
reads as follows:

:mmZ\dxZmx]Zpgy

The message is obviously encrypted using the enemy’s secret code. You
have just learned that their encryption method is based upon the ASCII
code. Appendix 3 shows the ASCII character set. Individual characters
in a string are encoded using this system. For example, the letter “A” is
encoded using the number 65 and “B” is encoded using the number 66.
Your enemy’s secret code takes each letter of the message and encrypts it
as follows:

If (OriginalChar + Key > 126) then
	EncryptedChar = 32 + ((OriginalChar + Key) – 127)
Else
	EncryptedChar = (OriginalChar + Key)

For example, if the enemy uses Key = 10 then the message “Hey” would
be encrypted as:

Character 	asCii code
--------------------
H				72
e				101
y				121

Encrypted H = (72 + 10) = 82 = R in ASCII
Encrypted e = (101 + 10) = 111 = o in ASCII
Encrypted y = 32 + ((121 + 10) – 127) = 36 = $ in ASCII

Consequently, “Hey” would be transmitted as “Ro$.”
Write a program that decrypts the intercepted message. The ASCII codes
for the unencrypted message are limited to the visible ASCII characters.
You only know that the key used is a number between 1 and 100. Your
program should try to decode the message using all possible keys between
1 and 100. When you try the valid key, the message will make sense. For
all other keys, the message will appear as gibberish
