To maintain one’s body weight, an adult human needs to consume enough
calories daily to 

	(1) meet the basal metabolic rate (energy required to breathe,
		maintain body temperature, etc.), 
	(2) account for physical activity such as exercise, and 
	(3) account for the energy required to digest the food that is being
	eaten. 
	
For an adult that weighs P pounds, we can estimate these caloric
requirements using the following formulas: 
	
		A. Basal metabolic rate: Calories required = 70 * (P / 2.2)^0.756 

		B. Physical activity: Calories required = 0.0385 * Intensity
		* P * Minutes here, Minutes is the number of minutes spent during the
		physical activity, and Intensity is a number that estimates the
		intensity of the activity. here are some sample numbers for the range
		of values:

				   Activity		 Intensity
				-----------------------------
				Running 10 mph:		17
				Running 6 mph: 		10
				Basketball: 			8
				Walking 1 mph: 		1

	C. Energy to digest food: 
				calories required = TotalCaloriesConsumed * 0.1 

In other words, 10 percent of the calories we consume goes towards digestion.
Write a function that computes the calories required for the basal metabolic
rate, taking as input a parameter for the person’s weight. Write another
function that computes the calories required for physical activity, taking as
input parameters for the intensity, weight, and minutes spent exercising.

Use these functions in a program that inputs a person’s weight, an estimate
for the intensity of physical activity, the number of minutes spent perform-
ing the physical activity, and the number of calories in one serving of your
favorite food. The program should then calculate and output how many
servings of that food should be eaten per day to maintain the person’s cur-
rent weight at the specified activity level. The computation should include
the energy that is required to digest food.
You can find estimates of the caloric content of many foods on the Web.
for example, a double cheeseburger has approximately 1000 calories.
