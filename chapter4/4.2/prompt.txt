Write a program that asks for the user’s height, weight, and age, and then
computes clothing sizes according to the formulas:

■ Hat size = weight in pounds divided by height in inches and all that
multiplied by 2.9.

■ Jacket size (chest in inches) = height times weight divided by 288 and
then adjusted by adding 1/8 of an inch for each 10 years over age 30.
(note that the adjustment only takes place after a full 10 years. So,
there is no adjustment for ages 30 through 39, but 1/8 of an inch is added
for age 40.)

■ Waist in inches = weight divided by 5.7 and then adjusted by adding 1/10
of an inch for each 2 years over age 28. (note that the adjustment only
takes place after a full 2 years. So, there is no adjustment for age 29,
but 1/10 of an inch is added for age 30.)

Use functions for each calculation. Your program should allow the user to
repeat this calculation as often as the user wishes.
