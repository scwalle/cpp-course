Write a program that accepts a year written as a four-digit Arabic (ordi-
nary) numeral and outputs the year written in roman numerals. important
roman numerals are V for 5, X for 10, L for 50, C for 100, d for 500, and M
for 1,000. recall that some numbers are formed by using a kind of subtrac-
tion of one roman “digit”; for example, iV is 4 produced as V minus i, XL
is 40, CM is 900, and so on. A few sample years: MCM is 1900, MCML is
1950, MCMLX is 1960, MCMXL is 1940, MCMLXXXiX is 1989. Assume the
year is between 1000 and 3000. Your program should include a loop that
lets the user repeat this calculation until the user says she or he is done.
