The keypad on your oven is used to enter the desired baking temperature
and is arranged like the digits on a phone:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
  0

unfortunately the circuitry is damaged and the digits in the leftmost col-
umn no longer function. in other words, the digits 1, 4, and 7 do not work.
if a recipe calls for a temperature that canâ€™t be entered, then you would
like to substitute a temperature that can be entered. Write a program that
inputs a desired temperature. The temperature must be between 0 and 999
degrees. if the desired temperature does not contain 1, 4, or 7, then output
the desired temperature. otherwise, compute the next largest and the next
smallest temperature that does not contain 1, 4, or 7 and output both.
For example, if the desired temperature is 450, then the program
should output 399 and 500. Similarly, if the desired temperature is
375, then the program should output 380 and 369.
