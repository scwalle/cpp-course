(This Project requires that you know some basic facts about complex num-
bers, so it is only appropriate if you have studied complex numbers in
some mathematics class.)

Write a C++ program that solves a quadratic equation to find its roots. The
roots of a quadratic equation

ax**2 + bx + c = 0 (where a is not zero) 

are given by the formula

(–b ± sqrt(b**2 – 4ac)) / 2a

The value of the discriminant (b**2 – 4ac) determines the nature of roots.
If the value of the discriminant is zero, then the equation has a single real
root. If the value of the discriminant is positive then the equation has two
real roots. If the value of the discriminant is negative, then the equation
has two complex roots.

The program takes values of a, b, and c as input and outputs the roots. Be
creative in how you output complex roots. Include a loop that allows the
user to repeat this calculation for new input values until the user says she
or he wants to end the program.
