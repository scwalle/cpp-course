Pennsylvania Avenue. in his usual sporting fashion, he has left the address
in the form of a puzzle. The address on Pennsylvania is a four-digit
number where:
• All four digits are different
• The digit in the thousands place is three times the digit in the tens place
• The number is odd
• The sum of the digits is 27
Write a program that uses a loop (or loops) to find the address where the
riddler plans to strike
